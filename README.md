mate-terminal-ir_black
========================

ir_black theme for mate terminal.

Installation
------------

To install, you must use gsettings. If you do not have this then you must use gconftool-2 but I have not implemented that yet (pull requests welcome!)

If you do have gsettings, ust run 

```
sh ./ir_black.sh
```
